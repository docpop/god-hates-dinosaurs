A silly comic book created in the style of a Chick Tract (those small religious books people hand out on street corners and malls). This book was created by [Doctor Popular] as part of the 24hr Comic Book Day challenge, then printed up and handed out to a thousand strangers in San Francisco. My hope in open sourcing this project is that people will remix, translate, and distribute their own versions of this silly book.
